# TinyASM
Tiny ASM is a software capable of running Assembly programs that use a custom instruction set.
## Instructions
The supported instructions are grouped by category
### Arithmetic

 - **ADD Ra, Rb, Rc**: sums the contents of the registers **Ra** and **Rb** and stores the result in **Rc** [*Rc=Ra+Rb*]
 - **SUB Ra, Rb, Rc**: subtracts the value stored in **Rb** from the value stored in **Ra**, storing the result in **Rc** [*Rc=Ra-Rb*]
### Logical
- **AND Ra, Rb, Rc**: performs the bitwise AND between the contents of **Ra** and **Rb**, storing the resulting value in **Rc** [*Rc=Ra&Rb*]
### Work in progress
This project is still a work in progress
